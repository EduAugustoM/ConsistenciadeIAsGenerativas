Here is an example implementation of a Person class in Python:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
```

This class has two attributes, `name` and `age`, which are set in the constructor (`__init__` method). It also has a `greet` method that prints a greeting message.

You can use this class like this:

```python
person = Person("John", 30)
person.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
