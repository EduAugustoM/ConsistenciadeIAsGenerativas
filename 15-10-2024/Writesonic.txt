Here is an example implementation of a Person class in Python:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
```

This class has two attributes, `name` and `age`, which are set in the constructor (`__init__` method). It also has a `greet` method that prints a greeting message using the person's name and age.

You can create instances of the `Person` class and call its methods like this:

```python
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

person2 = Person("Bob", 25)
person2.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.
```

Let me know if you have any other questions about this implementation or if you'd like me to explain or expand on it further.
